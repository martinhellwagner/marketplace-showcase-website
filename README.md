# Marketplace Showcase Website

## Introduction

This marketplace website acts as a showcase for various items which are up for sale. Why not get right to it and sell some stuff, shall we?

## How to get stared

To get started, you first need to make sure that you have the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en) installed. If you haven't, please do so before continuing. With these tools set up, you can go ahead and install the necessary packages by calling this command from the root directory:

    yarn install

After all the packages are installed, you are ready to start the application. Simply call this command from the root directory in order to compile your code for development (why yes, hot reload is included):

    yarn serve

If you want to get the project ready for production (i.e. compile and minify it), call this command from the root directory:

    yarn build

Last but not least, make sure the [Linter](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-eslint) is happy with you by calling the following command from the root directory (if applicable, fixing is included for free):

    yarn lint

That's about it. Happy hacking!
